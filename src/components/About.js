            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I've started programming in high school, but life got in the way... a lot. Now, I am able to give it my full attention again.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile I've become a decent frontend developer. I am comfortable using SASS and while I prefer to write my own CSS, I am familiar with CSS libraries like Tachyons, Materialize or Bootstrap.</p>
            <p>I have played with VanillaJS, ReactJS and Wordpress, I am able to use APIs or connect databases. I am familiar with mapping data for both mysql and nosql databases like Mongo or Firebase.</p>
            <p>Why pick me? Well, I am self-taught and I am a fast learner, I am used to manage my own workload and I don't need much babysitting, I love challenges and solving bugs but I am also capable of asking for help when I need it. I am a good team player and I work well under pressure.</p>
